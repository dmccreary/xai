## Level of Risk

In our course, we define five levels of risk related to making a prediction and needing a clear explanation of why a prediction was made.

1. **Passive Modification:** AI agents perform a background process that modifies resources but does not involve high-stakes
2. **Assisted Decision-Making** AI agents provide low-stakes recommendations where human confirmation is required before any action is taken.
3. **Opt-In High-Stakes:** A high-stakes recommendation and humans must opt-in to accept a recommendation made by an AI agent
4. **Opt-Out High-Stakes:** A high-stakes recommendation humans must opt-out to avoid a recommendation
5. **Autonomous High-Stakes:** A high-stakes recommendation and there are no humans in the loop
