# What is Explainable AI?

Welcome to our course on Explainable AI (XAI), where we embark on a journey through the fascinating world of artificial intelligence (AI) that is not only powerful but also interpretable and transparent. This course is designed to unravel the complexities of AI, making it understandable and accountable to a wide range of stakeholders, from developers to end-users.

## Defining Explainable AI

Explainable AI refers to methods and techniques in the field of artificial intelligence that make the outputs and operations of AI systems understandable to humans. Unlike traditional AI systems, where the decision-making process can be opaque, XAI aims to create a transparent relationship between the AI's functionality and its decision-making process.

## Comparing Systems: Simple vs. Deep-Learning Systems

To grasp the essence of XAI, it's crucial to understand the contrast between simple, easy-to-explain systems and complex deep-learning systems. Simple AI systems, like decision trees, are inherently transparent with clear-cut rules and predictable outcomes. On the other hand, deep-learning systems, utilizing neural networks with multiple layers, are akin to a "black box." They can process an immense amount of data and find patterns beyond human capabilities, but their internal workings are often not easily interpretable.

## White Box vs. Black Box Models

This brings us to the concepts of "White Box" and "Black Box" models in AI. White Box models are those where the internal logic is fully transparent and understandable to humans. In contrast, Black Box models are those where the decision-making process is not visible or understandable, making it challenging to decipher how the AI arrived at a specific decision.

## The Dangers of Non-Explainable Systems

The inability to understand or predict the behavior of AI systems poses significant risks. It can lead to a lack of trust, incorrect or unethical decision-making, and difficulties in identifying and correcting errors. In domains like healthcare, finance, and law, where decisions have profound impacts, the opaqueness of Black Box models can be particularly perilous.

## Tools to Classify Risk in AI Systems

To mitigate these risks, it's vital to have tools that can classify the risk associated with AI decisions. These tools assess factors like the impact of decisions, the complexity of models, and the possibility of bias, providing a framework to evaluate the potential harm or unintended consequences of AI decisions.

## Making Deep Neural Networks Explainable

Lastly, we will explore the tools and techniques to make deep neural networks more explainable. Techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and attention mechanisms can help illuminate the inner workings of complex models. We will delve into how these tools break down the AI's decision-making process, making it more transparent and understandable.

Throughout this course, we will explore these concepts in detail, equipping you with the knowledge to create, analyze, and advocate for AI systems that are not just powerful, but also responsible and explainable. Welcome aboard this exciting exploration into the world of Explainable AI.
